    <h1> BTS's Message through their songs </h1>
    <p1> BTS albums depict a person's life: from teenagers at school till adults. Unlike many other groups, who often talk about love between girls and boys, BTS write about friendship, lives, relationship, difficulties they face as an idol, their depression and comforting message towards the fans. Since the members write the lyrics and produce their songs, they have successfully convey their messages through their beautiful lyrics and music videos. </p1>
    <br>
    <h1> 2 COOL FOR SKOOL, O! RUL8, 2?, SKOOL LUV AFFAIR </h1>
    <p1> From these albums' songs and music videos, students' lives are clearly depicted through the school uniforms: from the harsh education system and high expectations from parents and schools to friendship and crushes. Moreover, the debut song named No More Dream sends messages to all students to chase their own dreams and not listen to others' expectations. The song N.O from O! RUL8, 2? (Oh! Are you late, too?) offers the message: "You must find your own hapiness and your own life before it is too late." </p1>

    <h1> DARK&amp;WILD,THE MOST BEAUTIFUL MOMENT IN LIFE SERIES </h1>
    <p1> Coming to DARK&amp;WILD, the boys are no longer in the school uniform. They are now adolescent and become tougher. For THE MOST BEAUTIFUL MOMENT IN LIFE series, BTS has focused on the start of one’s young adulthood in which beauty coexists with uncertainty in part 1, the energy of youth barreling forward, embracing even the uncertainty and insecurity in part 2. Now beginning to taste the bitterness of grown-up life, they can easily sense that life isn't always beautiful. However, they continue to sprint forward, relying only on their two destitute legs and the fire in their hearts. There’s nothing else to do but keep running. Facing the powerlessness of one’s youth, they collide and shatter and still cry out that “it’s okay to fall, it’s okay to get hurt.” That is the beauty of this moment. Beside the rapline (RM, Suga and Jhope) who wrote and produced previous songs and albums, the vocal line (Jin, Jimin, V and Jungkook) now add their names to the credits for the album's producing and songwriting </p1>

    <h1> WINGS </h1>
    <p1>  Concerning WINGS era, it contains songs about boys who encounter temptation for the first time and must ponder and agonize in the face of it. As the seven boys experience pain and bliss, they bring forth the image of birds that break out of their shells and try to take flight for the first time.</p1>

    <h1> YOU NEVER WALK ALONE</h1>    
    <p1> "We can laugh if we are together", a message of comfort and hope to the youth of this generation. YOU NEVER WALK ALONE completes the stories of youth and growth that could not be all contained in the WINGS album. Whereas THE MOST BEAUTIFUL MOMENT IN LIFE series and WINGS were narratives of youth and growth, this additional chapter to WINGS is a message of warm consolation and hope for the suffering youth of this generation. </p1>

    <h1> LOVE YOURSELF SERIES </h1>
    <p1> LOVE YOURSELF 承 'HER' is an expression of the anxiety and elation of love, told in the unique style of BTS. The “love” that BTS aims to convey in the LOVE YOURSELF series is both the individual experience of a boy growing into adulthood and a message of peace and unity to our society today. In the mini album 承 'HER' that begins this new narrative, the image of boys in love for the first time are expressed in a refreshing and cheerful take that aims to talk about the topic of “love” while immersed in a coming-of-age tale.</p1>
    <br><br>
    
    <center> <img src="lyher1.jpg"> </center>
    
    <br><br>
    <p1> Whereas the previously unveiled LOVE YOURSELF 起 ‘WONDER’ and LOVE YOURSELF 承 ‘HER’ albums expressed the heart-fluttering and tingling moments of love, LOVE YOURSELF 轉 ‘TEAR’ album embodies the pain of boys faced with parting. </p1>
    <br><br>

    <br><br>
    <p1> 'ANSWER’ is the final piece of the puzzle. Though it’s a repackaged album, LOVE YOURSELF 結 ‘ANSWER’ still includes seven brand-new tracks. CD A is a concept album, its sixteen tracks all connected lyrically to highlight BTS’ prowess as both artists and storytellers.</p1>

    <h1> MAP OF THE SOUL SERIES </h1>
    <p1>BTS signals the beginning of a brand new story with the release of their newest EP MAP OF THE SOUL : PERSONA on April 12. As global superstars who play stadiums and are loved by countless fans across the world, BTS now looks to shape the future reflecting on and using the power they have gained while embracing all its shadows. There are a total of seven tracks in this album, through which BTS weaves together what they genuinely felt both within themselves and the ever-widening world around them. Through RM’s solo piece ‘Intro : Persona’, BTS asks the fundamental question: ‘Who am I?’. World-leading singer Halsey takes part as featured artist in the lead single ‘Boy With Luv (Feat. Halsey)’ where BTS talks about how true strength and love come from finding joy in the little things in life and reaching out to the world.</p1>

<br><br>
    <p1> Unveiled in 2019, the MAP OF THE SOUL series contains the honest and heartfelt story of BTS and their journey of discovering their true selves. The first chapter of this story, “MAP OF THE SOUL : PERSONA”, sang about the world and the joy of love, and the discovery of the self as it is displayed to the world; “MAP OF THE SOUL : 7” now turns inward to the shadow within in a candid acknowledgement that it, too, is part of the self. <br>
    “MAP OF THE SOUL : 7” looks back on the past seven years of BTS since their debut as seven members of one team. The journey was not always smooth sailing, and there were special travails that they had to endure in their rise as global superstars. Now, understanding that the scars left by those hardships is a part of their real selves, BTS accepts both “the self I want to show” and the “self I want to scorn” to at last tell their own story of finding their “real and complete selves”.</p1>

    <h1> DYNAMITE </h1>
    <p1> The song was released as a comforting and cheering song for all people around the world during the Pandemic. The choreography is edgy and upbeat, with deeply addicting movements that highlight the distinct charms of each BTS member.</p1>
<br><br>
    
    <center> <img src="dynamite1.jpg"> </center>
<br> 
    <h1> BE </h1>
    <p1> As a sense of helplessness looms in every corner of the world, BTS opens themselves up to express their mixed feelings about this situation—fear and anxiety mingled with the determination to overcome all this. The album consists of a total of eight tracks including the No.1 summer hit “Dynamite” and lead single “Life Goes On”. The latter speaks on behalf of everyone stuck in the new normality brought on by COVID-19: one day, the world stopped without any warning, streets erased of footsteps and the way out is nowhere near in sight. BTS echoes in a low voice the comforting message that in the face of unexpected turns “Life Goes On” and extends their hands towards the future. </p1>
