  <h1> LOVE MYSELF CAMPAIGN </h1>
  <p> Among many presidents from different countries over the world, BTS had a chance to promote their Love Myself
    campaign with UNICEF at the UN to help people around the world, especially to protect children from violence. The
    meaningful speech of the leader of the group known as RM moved me to tears and held me spellbound: “Like most
    people, I made many mistakes in my life. I have many faults and I have many fears, but I am going to embrace myself
    as hard as I can, and I am starting to love myself, little by little. What is your name? Speak Yourself!”. On
    November 30, 2019, the campaign had fund of total 2,600 thousand dollars and nearly 12 million #BTSLoveMyself
    hashtag. BTS has succesfully used their songs to heal so many people over the world. The campaign is not only for
    those who have struggle with their mental health, but also protects children from violence. </p>

  <img src="/images/blm.jpg" class="center" alt="">
  <p> BTS has been against racism for many times by donating one million dollars for Black Lives Matter and having
    speech during their tours. On WINGS tour, RM, the leader of the group, has said: “Music and performance transcend
    language, countries and races. Do you feel that? Like a rainbow, I don’t care if you’re red, blue, orange, green,
    purple, whatever. Thank you for celebrating this great night together.”</p>

    children. </p>
